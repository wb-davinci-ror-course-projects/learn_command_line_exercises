## Task - Graphical file browser

I used my graphical file finder 'Finder' to locate the 'chapter_2' directory:

_(~/workspace/davinci_coders_t2_2014/learn_command_line_exercises/chapter_2$)_

#### I went into the top directory 'Macintosh HD'. 
#### Then I dropped down the Users directory and selected my home directory 'wb9753'
#### Next I opened up the 'workspace' directory and selected the 'davinci_coders_t2_2014' directory
#### From the 'davinci_coders_t2_2014' directory' I chose the 'learn_command_line_exercises' directory'
#### The 'chapter_2' directory was in the 'learn_command_line_exercises'
